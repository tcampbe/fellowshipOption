        We are Christian by faith and Southern Baptist by denomination.
        <br>
        <br>
        You become a Southern Baptist by uniting with a 
        Southern Baptist church, one in friendly cooperation with the 
        general Southern Baptist enterprise of reaching the world for 
        Christ. Typically church membership is a matter of receiving 
        Jesus as your Savior and Lord and experiencing believer's 
        baptism by immersion.
        <br>
        <br>
        Southern Baptists have prepared a statement of generally held 
        convictions called The Baptist Faith and Message. It serves 
        as a guide to understanding who they are. Copies are 
        available at Southern Baptist churches. The topics here 
        provide only a brief, partial summary.

        The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is 
        God's revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of 
        divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for 
        its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its 
        matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and 
        trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, 
        and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world 
        the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard 
        by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions 
        should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, 
        who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.

        He has the God-given responsibility to provide for, 
        to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to 
        submit herself graciously to the servant leadership 
        of her husband even as the church willingly submits 
        to the headship of Christ. She, being in the image
