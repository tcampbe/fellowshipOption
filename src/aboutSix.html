          You become a Southern Baptist by uniting with a Southern Baptist
          church, one in friendly cooperation with the general Southern
          Baptist enterprise of reaching the world for Christ. Typically
          church membership is a matter of receiving Jesus as your Savior and
          Lord and experiencing believer's baptism by immersion.
          <br />
          <br />
          Southern Baptists have prepared a statement of generally held
          convictions called The Baptist Faith and Message. It serves as a
          guide to understanding who they are. Copies are available at
          Southern Baptist churches. The topics here provide only a brief,
          partial summary.

          revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine
          instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and
          truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all
          Scripture is totally true and trustworthy. It reveals the principles
          by which God judges us, and therefore is, and will remain to the end
          of the world the true center of Christian union, and the supreme
          standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions
          should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is
          Himself the focus of divine revelation.

          of Christ, governed by His laws, exercising the gifts, rights, and
          privileges invested in them by His Word, and seeking to extend the
          gospel to the ends of the earth. Each congregation operates under
          the Lordship of Christ through democratic processes. In such a

          Lord. Its scriptural officers are pastors and deacons. While both
          men and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of

          wife is to submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of
          her husband even as the church willingly submits to the headship of
          Christ. She, being in the image of God as is her husband and thus
