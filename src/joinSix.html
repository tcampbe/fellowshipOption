      <h2>How to Join</h2>
      <p>
        We welcome your petition for membership at The Fellowship. There are
        several ports of entry into our fellowship, and we will work diligently
        to accommodate you and your needs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Anyone may join regardless of background, race, or social status, by
        professing faith in Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God. This
        profession will be followed by baptism by immersion in compliance with
        the Holy Scriptures. You then to attend a one-hour long orientation
        session which helps you understand what programs we offer. This
        orientation explains our church structure, programs, and expectations.
        You receive helpful materials and have a chance to ask questions about
        any concerns you may have. Upon completion, and mutual agreement, you
        have the option to join The Fellowship.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you belong to a Southern Baptist Church previously, then all that is
        needed, is the information about your former church. Our office will
        take care of the rest.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're coming from a sister church of another denomination, the
        orientation class will help us decide what steps we need to take to move
        you over into our congregation. This is necessary to ensure your
        happiness and fruitfulness as you attend here at The Fellowship.
