              We welcome your petition for membership at The Fellowship. There
              are several ports of entry into our fellowship, and we will work
              diligently to accommodate you and your needs.
              <br />
              <br />
              Anyone may join regardless of background, race, or social status,
              by professing faith in Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of
              God. This profession will be followed by baptism by immersion in
              compliance with the Holy Scriptures. You then attend a one-hour
              long orientation session which helps you understand what programs
              we offer. This orientation explains our church structure,
              programs, and expectations. You receive helpful materials and have
              a chance to ask questions about any concerns you may have. Upon
              completion, and mutual agreement, you have the option to join The
              Fellowship.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you belong to a Southern Baptist Church previously, then all
              that is needed, is the information about your former church. Our
              office will take care of the rest.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you're coming from a sister church of another denomination, the
              orientation class will help us decide what steps we need to take
              to move you over into our congregation. This is necessary to
              ensure your happiness and fruitfulness as you attend here at The
              Fellowship.
