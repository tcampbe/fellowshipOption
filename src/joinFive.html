            We welcome your petition for membership at The Fellowship. There are
            several ports of entry into our fellowship, and we will work
            diligently to accommodate you and your needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            Anyone may join regardless of background, race, or social status, by
            professing faith in Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God. This
            profession will be followed by baptism by immersion in compliance with
            the Holy Scriptures. You then to attend a one-hour long orientation
            session which helps you understand what programs we offer. This
            orientation explains our church structure, programs, and expectations.
            You receive helpful materials and have a chance to ask questions about
            any concerns you may have. Upon completion, and mutual agreement, you
            have the option to join The Fellowship.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you belong to a Southern Baptist Church previously, then all that
            is needed, is the information about your former church. Our office
            will take care of the rest.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you're coming from a sister church of another denomination, the
            orientation class will help us decide what steps we need to take to
            move you over into our congregation. This is necessary to ensure your
            happiness and fruitfulness as you attend here at The Fellowship.
